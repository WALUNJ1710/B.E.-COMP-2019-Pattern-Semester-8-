## Laboratory Practice 5
### High Performance Computing

1. Design and implement Parallel Breadth First Search and Depth First Search based on existing
algorithms using OpenMP. Use a Tree or an undirected graph for BFS and DFS .

2. Write a program to implement Parallel Bubble Sort and Merge sort using OpenMP. Use
existing algorithms and measure the performance of sequential and parallel algorithms.

3. Implement Min, Max, Sum and Average operations using Parallel Reduction.
4. Write a CUDA Program for :
1. Addition of two large vectors
2. Matrix Multiplication using CUDA C

### Deep Learning

1. Linear regression by using Deep Neural network: Implement Boston housing price 
predictionproblem by Linear regression using Deep Neural network. Use Boston House price 
predictiondataset.
